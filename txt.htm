    <p>You will not distribute, publish, send, or facilitate the sending of unsolicited mass e-mail or other messages, promotions, advertising, or solicitations (like “spam”), including commercial advertising and informational announcements. You will not alter or obscure mail headers or assume a sender’s identity without the sender’s explicit permission. You will not collect replies to messages sent from another internet service provider if those messages violate this AUP or the acceptable use policy of that provider. You must use reasonable efforts to secure any device or network within your control against being used in breach of the applicable laws against spam and unsolicited email, including where appropriate by the installation of antivirus software, firewall software and operating system and application software patches and updates. You will not take any action which directly or indirectly results in any of our IP addresses being listed on any abuse database (e.g., Spamhaus).</p>
    <p>You must comply with the laws and regulations applicable to bulk or commercial email in your jurisdiction. In addition, your bulk or commercial email must meet the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You must have a privacy policy or similar disclosure posted for each domain associated with the mailing;</li>
        <li>You must have the means to track anonymous complaints;</li>
        <li>You must not obscure the source of your e-mail in any manner;</li>
        <li>You must post an email address for complaints (such as abuse@yourdomain.com) in a conspicuous place on any website associated with the email, and you must promptly respond to messages sent to that address;</li>
        <li>Your intended recipients have given their consent to receive e-mail via some affirmative means, such as an opt-in procedure, and you can produce the evidence of such consent within 72 hours of receipt of a request by the recipient or Ortus Solutions;</li>

    </ul>
    <p>These mail policies apply to messages sent using the Services, or to messages sent from any System by you or any person on your behalf that directly or indirectly refer the recipient to a site hosted via the Services. In addition, you may not use a third-party e-mail service that does not practice similar procedures for all of its customers. These requirements apply to distribution lists created by third parties to the same extent as if you created the list.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Vulnerability Testing</h2>
    <p>You may not attempt to probe, scan, penetrate, or test the vulnerability of an Ortus Solutions system or network, or to breach the Ortus Solutions security or authentication measures, whether by passive or intrusive techniques, or conduct any security or malware research on or using the Services, without Ortus Solutions’ prior written consent.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Excessive Use of Shared System Resources</h2>
    <p>You may not use any shared System provided by Ortus Solutions in a way that unnecessarily interferes with the normal operation of the shared System, or that consumes a disproportionate share of the resources of the System. For example, we may require you to repair coding abnormalities in your cloud-hosted code if it unnecessarily conflicts with other customers’ use of the Services. You agree that we may quarantine or delete any data stored on a shared System if the data is infected with a virus, or is otherwise corrupted, and has the potential to infect or corrupt the System or other customers’ data that is stored on the same system.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>You must have valid and current information on file with your domain name registrar for any domain hosted on the Ortus Solutions network. You may only use IP addresses assigned to you by Ortus Solutions in connection with your Ortus Solutions Service. You agree that if you register a DNS record or zone on Ortus Solutions-managed or operated DNS servers or services for a domain of which you are not the registrant or administrative contact according to the registrars’ WHOIS system, that, upon request from the registrant or administrative contact according to the registrars WHOIS system, Ortus Solutions may modify, transfer, or delete such records or zones.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Our Monitoring and Enforcement</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to investigate any suspected violation of this AUP or misuse of the Services about which we have actual knowledge. In connection with such investigations, we may report any activity that we suspect violates any law or regulation to appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other appropriate third parties. Such reporting may include disclosing, reviewing and preserving appropriate customer information consistent with applicable law.

    <br>

Our right to suspend or terminate your use of the Services applies even if a violation is committed unintentionally or without your authorization.
